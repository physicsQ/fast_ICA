INTRODUCTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This code is the realization of Fast Indepedent Component Analysis (FAST_ICA)
proposed by Aapo Hyvarinen and Erkki Oja in their paper. Suppose you have n 
independent sound sources are producing sound track: s1, s2, ..., sn. The obs-
ervation you have are n mixed sound track: x1, x2, ..., xn. The fast ICA is an
algorithm that can reproduce the original n sound tracks.
